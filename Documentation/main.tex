    %Material for the oral presentation (slides), which should focus on the process: what decisions were taken and why, which strengths/shortcomings were found, and a critical discussions of the results.

\section{Gabor Filter}

%Think as Gabor as a Gaussian filter in 2D.


A band pass filter generated by a function of various parameters.

\begin{equation}
    filter(x,y;\sigma,\theta,\lambda,\gamma,\phi) = exp [ - \frac{x^2 - \gamma ^2 \cdot y^2}{2 \sigma^2} ] \cdot exp [ i (2 \pi \frac{x}{\lambda} + \phi) ] 
\end{equation}


% Large sigma on small feature you will miss
% Small sigma on ...

The parameters of ksize allows to select the size of our kernel filter, in case we are using a really big shape we will overlook details if the shapes are small. The same reasoning can be applyed with a small filter, may overlook shapes too big for it. Therefore, must be tested with different sizes to reach an idoneal spot, if your features are tiny or bigger, you have to take that in count.

If we are looking for \textbf{horizontal-like} features, applying an horizontal filter will allow us to maintain those characteristics and block the vertical ones and viceversa in the other cases.


\section{What form do the People have?}

In general the shapes that a person can describe may suffer alot of distorsion depending of the angle where the frame was took, the person posture, etc. Not always will be a perfet pose to the researchers to easily identify if an object is a person or not. There is no key shape that we could use, but we can try use common sense. The images gathered, are related to people moving standing up, swiming or just taking sunbathing.
